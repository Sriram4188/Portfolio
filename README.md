This web project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic personal resume website. The index.html file provides the page's structure, while front.css handles the visual styling, including hover effects and a responsive layout using Flexbox. The front.js script adds interactivity, such as expanding the profile picture on click and revealing hidden content on hover.
